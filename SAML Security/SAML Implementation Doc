Working of SAML : (Refer above link for Img representation of SAML Working)
    -> The request is made by user to its target resrc.
    -> If the request made is authenticated, then  it directly redirects to the target resrc.
    -> If it is not authenticated, then the web-app rsponds the browser with SAML request.
    -> Then the browser sends this request to the IDP.
    -> The IDP prompts the user to enter their creds.
    -> Then it verifies the user and creates the SAML Response for the browser.
    -> The Browser then sends this SAML Response to the Servce Provider.
    -> The SP verifies the response Object sent by the browser.
    -> If it succeeds, then the user is redirected to the target resrc or it is responded with 401 Unauthorized.

Lets Configure the OKTA IDP :
    -> Create free developer account i.e. Okta Developer Edition Service (if not). https://developer.okta.com/signup/
    -> Go on Applications, under that "Create App Integrations". Select SAML2.0, give a name to your App
    ->
